    AMF Gateway Configuration File - Version 1.1

    This presence of this file overrides the legacy behavior of
    the gateway. It allows the developer to customize which
    services are available.

    This file also introduces the concept of a basic whitelist
    which allows the developer to restrict access to
    particular classes and JNDI names.
